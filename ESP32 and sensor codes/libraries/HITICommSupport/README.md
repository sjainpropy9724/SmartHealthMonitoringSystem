# HITICommSupport
Arduino support library for HITIComm library. 
Optimized for working with HITISoftware products (Tahiti Robotics SARL).
<br>

# Support library
HITIComm is an open-source library but it requires a large amount of Arduino program memory (15kB). 
To speed up compilation, it is supplied pre-compiled to users.  
However, the compiled file called "libHITIComm.a" is processor architecture-dependant (atmega328p, cortex-m0plus,...) and not board dependant.
And HITIComm uses many board-dependant macros that can only be resolved at compile time. 
The job of HITICommSupport is to resolve those macros before they are used by HITIComm.
